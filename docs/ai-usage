AI Use Log: SRA Toolkit

-ChatGPT4. Config setup for toolkit installation following https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/03.-Quick-Toolkit-Configuration tutorial.
  Open config in cmd.exe with vdb-config -i. Navigate using Tab and enable caching and remote access. Create a cache file under C:\SRA\cache and establish the cache location.

AI Use Log: Colab

-Gemini. Check if `fly_amplicon.zip` is in `/content/`. The file was not correctly uploaded to the content directory. 
  Code generated to confirm the file is in he correct /content/ directory. Accuracy tested by confirming file location. 
-Gemini. Invalid value for '--i-data': /content/fly_project/results/demux.qza does not exist. Adjust the manifest file and make corrections to run qiime2 analysis. 
  The column absolute-filepath-direction was not recognized and changed to absolute-filepath. The manifest.tsv path was changed from windows format to linux to operate in a colab environment. User assisted 
- Gemini. Debug info saved. Please exmaine the error and suggest corrections to !qiime diversity alpha-group-significance \. It's likely that the metadata file doesn't contain a suitable categorical column
  (i.e., a column with at least two different values that are not all unique and not all empty) for the visualization to work. I will add a code cell to display the contents of your metadata.tsv file 
  so we can inspect it and identify the problematic column. Additional variables were added to the metadata file to run qiime diversity command. Success was tested by confirming the output of visualization files.
