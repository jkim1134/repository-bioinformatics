# This is a basic workflow to start with Qiime2 analysis

# FASTQ files downloaded directly from NCBI will not provide quality scores. An SRA Toolkit is required

# Follow the installation guide below and open in Terminal
  # Note: Make sure all commands are run in C:\Users\name\Desktop\sratoolkit.3.2.1-win64\bin>

# Open config 
vdb-config -i
  # Navigate using Tab/Enter. Enable the following:
    # Remote Access
      # Prefer SRA Lite files (optional, disable if errors with file transfer during prefetch occur)
  # Navigate to Cache. Enable the following:
    # Local file-caching
  # Set the location of the user-repository: Create an empty folder named "cache" for files to go 
    # Specify the location of the cache in the config
  # Navigate to Cloud Provider
    # Enable "Report cloud instance identity" 
  # Save and exit the config
    # Create a folder named "SRA" to hold "cache" folder and additional directories
      # Within "SRA" create a folder "fastq" to store fininshed FASTQ files
        # Open the "cache" folder and create a folder "sra" to store SRA files 

# (Optional) Test the files are correctly placed 
prefetch SRR390728
  # The file should download into C:\SRA\cache\sra\SRR390728.sra or the specified cache location
fasterq-dump SRRXXXXX --split-files -temp C:\SRA\temp
  # Paired end reads
fasterq-dump SRRXXXXX --temp C:\SRA\temp
  # Single end reads
move SRRXXXXX.fastq C:\SRA\fastq
  # The file should show up in the "fastq" folder

# Ready to begin Qiime2 analysis
